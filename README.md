## Description:
turtle_game.py is a simple Python game where the player must avoid moving cars while crossing the screen.
It includes:

1. A game window with a black background.

2. A player-controlled character that moves up and down.

3. Multiple cars that move horizontally across the screen.

4. Collision detection between the player and the cars.

5. A win condition when the player reaches the top of the screen.

## Controls:
Player:

Move Up: "Up" arrow key

Move Down: "Down" arrow key

## Usage:
Clone this repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/CarlosValerioM/Turtle-Crossing-Game.git
```
Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd Turtle-Crossing-Game
```
Run the script:

```bash
python main.py
```
## How It Works:
The player starts at the bottom of the screen.

Cars appear and move from one side of the screen to the other.

The player must navigate through the moving cars without getting hit.

If the player reaches the top of the screen, they win.

If the player collides with a car, the game ends.
